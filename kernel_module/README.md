# SNVMe
Share the NVMe device between the CPU and GPU.

To realize it, we modified the process of nvme_reset_work to allocated Pages on GPU, and reture its address address to create IO queue;

## IOCTL cmd to set up snvme and create DMA MAP
### NVM_SET_IOQ_NUM
To set the upper limit of IOQs.
### NVM_MAP_HOST_MEMORY and NVM_MAP_DEVICE_MEMORY
To reg a user/device space into snvme, and convert the vaddr to dma addr. the num of map is limited by NVM_SET_IOQ_NUM.
### NVM_SET_SHARE_REG
Set whether the registered map will be used during snvme device registration.
### NVM_UNMAP_MEMORY
To unreg the map on the snvme, the input para include the vaddr of the registered map.

## The Process of user defined IO queue 



### create IO queue, map the userspace, reg the addr into kernel
create io queue struct, create the map, identify the map attr(sq or cq, and its corresponding sq/cq )

The idx of IO queues is is arrange follow this rule (assume 6 ioqs, 2 cq 4 sq)ï¼š
[pci_dev1,cq,0] [pci_dev1,cq,1] [pci_dev1,sq,2] [pci_dev1,sq,3] [pci_dev1,sq,4] [pci_dev1,sq,5] 
### using the NVM_SET_SHARE_REG, and using SNVM_REGISTER_DRIVER to initizalized the nvme module
